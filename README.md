# SzismTools
Szism is really small right now and pretty much used just to shorten the turnaround it takes for me to develop websites. As I
find more things that need to be automated and better ways to organize my plugins I will update it. Stay tuned.

If you are using a Linux/Unix based operating system (Mac as well, as I believe it will function the same) all
you have to do is add the scripts directory to your BashRC and call various functions on the directory you 
are working on.
